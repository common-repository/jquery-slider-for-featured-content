This jQuery slider displays up to four recent posts in a featured slideshow. Displays pictures, captions, and links to the posts.

**Key Features:**

* Posts are automatically added to the slider if they are part of the chosen category.
* Posts tagged with picture urls in the custom field "slider-image" will be automatically resized and inserted into the slider.
* Fully customizable!  You can change the font, text size, transition type, and transition speed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `jquery-slider-for-featured-content` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place ` <?php include(FCG_PLUGIN_FILE); ?>` in your templates

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you display more than 4 posts in the slider at once? =

No, only the four most recent posts will be shown.

= It won't work.  Can you help me? =

Yes, go to our webpage for [Support](http://www.jqueryslider.org/sub/support "Support") 

= Did you actually catch the fish in the screenshot? =

Yes. It is a cutthroat trout caught on South Fork of the Snake River.

= Can you change the size of the slider to make it fit my theme? =

No, we can't.  If you're having problems getting the slider to work with your theme you might consider getting a new theme with a slider built in.  <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=779886&c=ib&aff=143939&cl=88913" target="ejejcsingle">Organic Themes</a> has some great themes like these, but you can find them from others as well.
